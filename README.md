# MyContacts
A simple example of using Contacts and ContactsUI framework

### It seems severe bugs are fixed in Xcode 7/iOS9 SDK beta 3. Of course NO WARRANTIES terms are still (and being in the future) valid.
As for now, CNContactViewController(forUnknownContact:) does not work as ABUnknownPersonViewController do in iOS8. Checking if it's a bug or my misunderstanding or misusage. Any info welcome.

UI, functionality and method-class designs are taken from Apple's QuickContacts sample code.
