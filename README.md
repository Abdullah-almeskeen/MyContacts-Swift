# MyContacts
A simple example of using Contacts and ContactsUI framework

## It seems ContactsUI still has severe bugs. This sample code does not contain any sort of workarounds and may harm your device if you run it on.

UI, functionality and method-class designs are taken from Apple's QuickContacts sample code.
